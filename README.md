Quantum circuit simulations are essential for verifying quantum algorithms on real quantum devices. However, the memory requirements for such simulations grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved in quantum programs. Moreover, a substantial number of computations in quantum circuit simulations cause low-locality data accesses, as they require extensive computations across the entire table of the full state vector. These characteristics lead to significant latency and energy overheads during data transfers between the CPU and main memory. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational logic near DRAM banks, could present a promising solution to address these challenges. In this project, we will implement QuantumPIM to achieve fast, energy-efficient quantum circuit simulation.

This project was written for the FYS (first-year scholars) programme at Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering'
